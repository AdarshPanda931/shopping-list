WE NEED TO ADD THE FOLLOWING THINGS IN THE PROJECT ACCORDING TO THE COMMAND , I HAVE WRITEN THE COMAND EXECUTION , ISSUES FACED & SOLUTION OF THE ISSUE

## 1. If you click on the list item, it toggles the .done  class on and off
```
var button = document.getElementById("enter");
var input = document.getElementById("userinput");
var ul = document.querySelector("ul");
var erase = document.getElementsByClassName("del");

function inputLength() {
  return input.value.length;
}

function createListElement() {
  var li = document.createElement("li");
  li.appendChild(document.createTextNode(input.value));
  ul.appendChild(li);
  input.value = "";

  // Add click event listener to toggle the "done" class
  li.addEventListener("click", function() {
    li.classList.toggle("done");
  });
}

function addListAfterClick() {
  if (inputLength() > 0) {
    createListElement();
  }
}

function addListAfterKeypress(event) {
  if (inputLength() > 0 && event.keyCode === 13) {
    createListElement();
  }
}

button.addEventListener("click", addListAfterClick);
input.addEventListener("keypress", addListAfterKeypress);
```
## The done class is defined in the style.css file only , not in the index.html file , but for this don't i need to have a done class in the index.html file aswell , otherwise how will style.css file access the class, that does not exist in index.html or has the done class been specified somewhere in the index.html file. please explain this issue fundamentally from the root 

ðŸ‘‰Certainly, let's clarify this point.

In web development, the HTML file is responsible for the structure of your webpage, the CSS file for styling, and the JavaScript file for behavior or functionality. The HTML file should include elements (with classes, ids, etc.) that are then styled by the CSS file and manipulated by the JavaScript file.

Here's how it works:

1. HTML File (index.html):
In your index.html file, you have a structure that includes the creation of list items. At this point, you do not explicitly assign the done class in the HTML. For example, you have list items like this:
```
<ul>
    <li class="bold red" random="23">Notebook <button class="del">delete</button></li>
    <!-- Other list items -->
</ul>
```
Notice that there is no done class in the HTML file at the beginning.

2. CSS File (style.css):
In your style.css file, you define the style for the done class:
```
.done {
  text-decoration: line-through;
}
```
This CSS rule says that any element with the class done should have a line-through text decoration.

3. JavaScript File (script.js):
In your script.js file, you dynamically add and remove the done class to the list items when they are clicked:
```
li.addEventListener("click", function() {
  li.classList.toggle("done");
});
```
This JavaScript code uses the classList.toggle("done") method to add the done class if it's not present and remove it if it is.

## conclusion
### So, to directly answer your question: Yes, you're correct. In the initial state of the index.html file, there is no done class explicitly specified. However, the JavaScript code dynamically adds and removes the done class as needed when the list items are clicked. This is a common practice in dynamic web applications where classes are often added or removed based on user interactions.
